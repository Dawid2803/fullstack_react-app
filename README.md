# fullstack_react-app

This is the final project for my fullstack javascript Treehouse Certification, it consists of a SqlLite db, a backend api to update the db and a front-end client side React app. The React app uses the api to make calls to the db to make the required changes. Basic authorisation and sign in functions have also been implemented.
